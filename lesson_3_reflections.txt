When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are adding commits from another computer, or if 
  someone else is adding to your file, you would use a 
  remote repository.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because collaborators may be working on the files 
    and you may not want their changes to come across 
    automatically into your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks allow you to make a copy of somebody else's
    repository directly on to the GitHub servers. 
    Branches happen on a local repository, and a clone
    creates a copy of a repository from an existing 
    repository, either local to local, or from GitHub
    to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
