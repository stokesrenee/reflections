What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you initialize a repository, you create the .git repository. You need to do it because that's where the commit history is stored.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area stores information about what will go into your next commit. The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project, and the repository is where Git stores the metadata for the project. I think it's useful to get your files exactly how you want them before you commit.
